GeneExpressionToolkit

The GeneExpressionToolkit is a collection of R scripts and utilities designed for the manipulation, transformation, and analysis of gene expression data. This toolkit is particularly focused on processing Transcript Per Million (TPM) data from omics studies, facilitating bioinformatics analyses in the field of genomics and transcriptomics.

Features

Data Transformation: Scripts to transpose, normalize, and prepare gene expression datasets for analysis.
Gene Expression Analysis: Utilities for analyzing expression levels, identifying differentially expressed genes, and more.
Data Subsetting: Tools to filter and subset expression datasets based on various criteria like sample annotations or expression thresholds.
Visualization: Code snippets for generating insightful visualizations of gene expression data.
Performance Optimization: Examples of using data.table for efficient data manipulation in R, suitable for large datasets.
